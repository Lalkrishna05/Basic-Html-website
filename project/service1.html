                                producing computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers,
                                and related services. Headquartered at the Microsoft campus in Redmond,
                                Washington, Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line
                                of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer
                                and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video
                                game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal
                                computers. Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of
                                the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

                            <h3>Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop
                                and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal
                                computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows.
                                The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its
                                share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires
                                among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified
                                from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions,
                                their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016.
