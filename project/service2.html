                            <h3 align="center">Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington, on July 5, 1994.
                                Even with humble beginnings, the history of Amazon was off to a roaring start, generating
                                 far beyond any ole' garage sale.Within 30 days, Amazon generated $20,000 per week
                                  in sales.In just a few months, Amazon had customers in every U.S. state plus 45
                                   countries.By the end of the year, Bezos employed 250 employees.Yet, Amazon was 
                                   snowballing—Bezos needed additional capital to meet increased demand. In 1997, Bezos 
                                   decided to release Amazon's IPO at just $18.00 per share. If you managed to snag some
                                    shares, you're potentially sitting on a stack of cash. "$10,000 invested on that day 
                                    and price would be worth more than $12 million as of May 2020," according to Investopedia.
                                    Amazon raised $54 million. The funding went to growing Amazon.com as the leading online 
                                    retailer of books of its time.
