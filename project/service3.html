                                 Roebuck and Company public.The deal was facilitated by Henry Goldman's personal 
                                 friendship with Julius Rosenwald, an owner of Sears.Other IPOs followed, 
                                 including F. W. Woolworth and Continental Can. In 1912, Henry S. Bowers became
